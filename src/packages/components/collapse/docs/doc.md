          life, and comply with languages and habits that the users are used to;
        </div>
        <div>
          Consistent within interface: all elements should be consistent, such
          as: design style, icons and texts, position of elements, etc.
        </div>
      </l-collapse-item>
      <l-collapse-item title="Feedback" name="2">

          operations by style updates and interactive effects;
        </div>
        <div>
          Visual feedback: reflect current state by updating or rearranging

          users can quickly understand and make decisions;
        </div>
        <div>
          Easy to identify: the interface should be straightforward, which helps
          the users to identify and frees them from memorizing and recalling.

      </l-collapse-item>
      <l-collapse-item title="Controllability" name="4">
        <div>

          not make decisions for the users;
        </div>
        <div>
          Controlled consequences: users should be granted the freedom to
          operate, including canceling, aborting or terminating current

      </l-collapse-item>
